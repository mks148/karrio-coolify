# Insiders

Karrio is adopting the sponsorware release strategy, which means that new features are first exclusively released to sponsors as part of Insiders.
Read on to learn what sponsorships achieve, how to become a sponsor to get access to Insiders, and what's in it for you!

## What is Insiders?

Karrio Insiders is a private fork of Karrio, hosted as a private GitHub repository.
Almost all new features are developed as part of this fork, which means that they are immediately available
to all eligible sponsors, as they are made collaborators of this repository.

Whike Karrio main focus is shipping integration and the core multi-carrier shipping API. Karrio Insiders is for those who want to
build their custom shipping software and portals on top of Karrio.

## What sponsorships achieve

Sponsorships make this project sustainable, as they buy the maintainers of this project time – a very scarce resource – which is spent on the
development of new features, bug fixing, stability improvement, issue triage and general support.
The biggest bottleneck in Open Source is time.

## What do you get with Insiders?

The moment you join Karrio Insiders, you'll get immediate access to additional features that you can start using now,
and which are currently exclusively available to sponsors:

-   Multi-tenant
-   Advanced team and permissions managment
-   Shipping workflow (alpha)
-   Shipping rules (soon)
-   Orders CSV imports and batch fulfilment (soon)
-   Shipments CSV imports and batch tracking (soon)
-   Carrier billing management and consolidation (soon)

## How to join?
