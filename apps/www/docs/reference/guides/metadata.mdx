# Metadata

Updateable Karrio objectsâ€”including Shipment and Order have a metadata parameter.
You can use this parameter to attach key-value data to these Karrio objects.

Metadata is useful for storing additional, structured information on an object.
As an example, you could store your user's full name and corresponding unique identifier
from your system on a Karrio Order object.

Do not store any sensitive information as metadata.
