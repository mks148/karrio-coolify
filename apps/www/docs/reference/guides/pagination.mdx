# Pagination

All top-level API resources have support for bulk fetches via "list" API methods. For instance, you can list addresses,
list shipments, and list trackers. These list API methods share a common structure, taking at least these
two parameters: limit, and offset.

Karrio utilizes offset-based pagination via the offset and limit parameters.
Both parameters take a number as value (see below) and return objects in reverse chronological order.
The offset parameter returns objects listed after an index.
The limit parameter take a limit on the number of objects to be returned from 1 to 100.


```json
{
    "count": 100,
    "next": "/v1/shipments?limit=25&offset=50",
    "previous": "/v1/shipments?limit=25&offset=25",
    "results": [
        { ... },
    ]
}
```
