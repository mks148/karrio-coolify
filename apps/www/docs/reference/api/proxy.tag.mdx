In some scenarios, all we need is to send request to a carrier using the Karrio unified API.
                The Proxy API comes handy for that as it turn Karrio into a simple middleware that converts and
                validate your request and simply forward it to the shipping carrier server.<br/>
                **Note:**<br/>
                    When using the proxy API, no objects are created in the Karrio system.
                    excpet API logs and tracing records for debugging purposes.
